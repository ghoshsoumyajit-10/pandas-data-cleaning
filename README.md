# pandas-data-cleaning
End-to-end data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis on real-world ESPN Cricinfo cricket statistics imported using web scrapping and using Python and pandas.

Project Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data cleaning and preprocessing workflow using Python’s pandas library on real-world ESPN Cricinfo cricket statistics. It includes web-scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and robust data transformation techniques to handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and structural irregularities, enabling downstream analysis and insights. Key steps such as data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and basic visualization are implemented to showcase practical data preprocessing skills relevant for data science and analytics applications.
